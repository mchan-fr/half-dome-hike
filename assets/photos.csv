Since sleeping in your car overnight isn't allowed, I’ll say we ""rested"" for an hour and a half. That’s clearly not enough sleep for a hike like this, but that’s what we had to work with. We got up at 2:45 a.m., in the dead of night, and geared up. (Photo by Griffin)"
002,37.73023,-119.55794,2025-08-08T04:13:00-07:00,photos/002.jpeg,Mist Trail Sign,"We cycled to Happy Isles, where we parked our bikes, then made our way to the Mist Trail. It was 4 a.m., and the top of Half Dome was a ""mere"" 8.2 miles away."
003,37.72654,-119.5431,2025-08-08T04:58:00-07:00,photos/003.jpeg,Vernal Fall Steps,"For the first hour or so, we ran into a few people and groups, but mostly we were alone. I wondered how it would be hiking the steep steps along Vernal Fall by headlamp. As long as you keep your light and eyes focused on the next step, it’s fine. Otherwise, it can be a bit disorienting staring into the darkness as you're ascending the uneven stairs."

This was the perfect time to refuel on actual food – and I wish I had done this more later in the hike, rather than rely heavily on packaged snacks that didn’t seem to sustain my energy levels the same way."
005,37.72633611,-119.53398056,2025-08-08T05:59-07:00,photos/005.jpeg,Below Nevada Fall,"We were in darkness for less than 2 hours. By 6 a.m., we had full light as we neared Nevada Fall. Hiking while the air was still cool and the sun wasn't blazing was ideal."
006,37.73220556,-119.52102778,2025-08-08T06:50-07:00,photos/006.jpeg,Golden Half Dome,"About 40 minutes later, we were treated to our first close-up view of Half Dome, which emanated a vibrant gold color, courtesy of the rising sun. We couldn’t help but stare, with a mixture of awe for its beauty, as well as a bit of unease – we were headed to the top of this thing! (Photo by Whitney)"
007,37.74879444,-119.52721389,2025-08-08T09:15-07:00,photos/007.jpeg,Beginning of Sub Dome,"At 9:15 a.m., about five hours into our hike, we reached Sub Dome, a big hump that’s the last section before reaching the cables of Half Dome. The signage greeted us with ""stop"" (if you don’t have a permit), ""dangerous,"" ""deadly"" and ""turn back"" (if there’s lightning or rain), plus a picture of a skull and bones, I assume drawn by the park ranger. Other than that, welcome!"
008,37.74821111,-119.52755833,2025-08-08T09:26-07:00,photos/008.jpeg,Going Up Sub Dome,"The path up Sub Dome consists of steps, switchbacks and sections where there doesn’t seem to be one well-worn path. The Half Dome cables rightfully get all the attention, but don’t look past the Sub Dome. There are sharp drop-offs on either side, and the incline will get your heart pumping."
009,37.74671667,-119.52991389,2025-08-08T09:46-07:00,photos/009.jpeg,The Infamous Cables,"Half an hour after the ""welcome"" signs, we reached the top of Sub Dome and got our closest look yet of the cables. As other groups of hikers gathered in the same spot, looking at the dots of people along the 400-foot-long cable, we heard a lot of nervous chatter and motivational self-talk. My son Griffin’s expression sort of captured the vibe. (Photo by Whitney)"
010,37.74635833,-119.53088333,2025-08-08T10:09-07:00,videos/cables.mp4,Go Time,"After a quick snack, we got up, received a “good luck” and some encouraging smiles from friendlies in other hiking groups, and trotted down the short slope of Sub Dome to the base of the cables, where the face of the rock is not only steep, so are the drop-offs on the right and left. (Video by Griffin)"
011,37.74635833,-119.53088333,2025-08-08T10:09-07:00,photos/010.jpeg,Up the Cables,"Some 15 hours after leaving San Francisco, we were now 400 feet from the top of Half Dome. With little hesitation – and perhaps partly motivated by wanting to get this over with – my kids lurched toward the cables and began their ascent. I barely had a moment to snap this photo."
012,37.74561389,-119.53292222,2025-08-08T10:50-07:00,photos/011.jpeg,Nearing the Top,"During the ascent, I didn't take any photos because my hands were glued to the cables. The only moment I wished I had my phone out was when someone way ahead of me lost their water bottle. Everyone sort of froze as the hard plastic bottle tumbled loudly down our left side. A friendly woman behind me on the cables, whom I had been chatting with, said to me, ""I am NOT going to watch that bottle fall."" I can understand why – the bottle kept falling, and falling, and falling, until it disappeared down the steep side of Half Dome. It was an amusing-not-amusing reminder of just how sharp the drop-off was. Not that we needed any more motivation to get off these cables, but it wasn't long after that we neared the summit and the climb leveled off. (Photo by Griffin)"

014,37.74611389,-119.53305833,2025-08-08T11:23-07:00,photos/012.jpeg,Proud Papa Bear,"My first profound moment with any mountain was in October 1997, when my dad took me to Nepal. It was there while in Pokhara, near the Annapurna region, that I first laid eyes on Fishtail Mountain (Machapuchare). I had never seen a mountain pierce the sky like that. That trip with my father cemented in me this thing about mountains and peaks, and the marathon treks one must embark on to access these views and perspectives. So I was thankful to be a part of my kids' Half Dome experience and perhaps pass down a bit of what my father gave to me."
015,37.74622778,-119.53120556,2025-08-08T12:10-07:00,photos/013.jpeg,Time to Descend,"That moment of meaning quickly gave way to the concensus desire to get off this rock. The sun was now blazing, the effects of almost no sleep overtook the adrenaline that powered us up the cables, and we still had more than 8 miles to go. After half an hour on the summit, we descended. Whitney went backwards down the cables, which many folks find easier to do."
016,37.74622778,-119.53120556,2025-08-08T12:20-07:00,photos/014.jpeg,Crowded Cables,"When we ascended at around 10 a.m., only a handful of folks were descending the cables. Now that it was past noon, there was a traffic jam of folks going in both directions. It wasn't a big deal because most everyone was polite and communicative – ""Can I pass you up?"" or some version of that enabled folks who wanted to rest to rest and those who had ants in their pants to keep moving. I also know there's been some debate about whether or not to use a harness. I was surprised to see many people using harnesses, clipping in and out as they passed each pole. During my descent, it seemed like roughly half the hikers were using a harness. And it didn't really slow anyone down. (Photo by Griffin)"

So we got water from the Merced River near Little Yosemite Valley Campground (the last spot to filter water on the way up). (Video by Griffin)"

Here I am trekking alongside Vernal Fall during hour 13. Cleary, my kids would have been back at the car by now if not for me. I guess this is the bonding-over-exhaustion part. (Photo by Griffin)"

Not sure what was top of Grif's mind. No matter. We reached the top, enabled by our ability to endure 14 hours of one foot in front of the other. Next up: Mt. Whitney. (Video by Griffin)"
